# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
In our fast paced busy lives, while we focus on getting things done - we may forget taking care of ourselves. This application comes to one's aid by doing some of the heavylifting when it comes to positive self talk.

- The application gives the user a portal to stumble upon, and store, positive and reassuring messages.
- The positive messages are randomized but aren't repeated.
- The user can choose whether to view affirmations or mantras.
- Once the messages are exhausted, the user is notified but they can still continue to browse through the same messages again.
- The user can favorite any and as many messages as they like.
- The favorites aren't duplicated even if the favorite button is clicked twice on the same message.
- The favorites can be viewed in a separate tab. 
- The favorites list is editable. Individual messages can be deleted.

### Context:
I worked on the application for about 15 hours. I chose these features to double down on my existing strengths and enable deep learning for topics I thought I understood but might have struggled to build on from scratch.
At the time of doing this project, I am 3 weeks into mod 1 of Turing.

### Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
- I used event delegation effectively. My event listeners were attached to my overall sections and not the specific child elements. However, I'd have the invoked functions do something (desirable) only if the child class was what I had intended it to be. This avoided undesired behaviors in the website.
- I used multiple functions to take up differing resonsibilities. 
- I did not run into too many problems that I hadn't anticipated. I feel confident about my pseudocoding.

Challenges: 
- Being new at CSS posed some challenges. My trouble shooting skills were honed in this project because I was console logging efficiently. As soon as something broke, I knew just what to console log and eventually could zero down on the right point of failure.
- The multiple moving parts of HTML, CSS and Javascript are sometimes too much to remember. I consciously prefixed HTML imported elements in JS with "dom" to have my code be more readable.
